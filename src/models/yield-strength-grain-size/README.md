This database is created from a database released for [Kumar, P., Kabra, S., & Cole, J. M. (2022). auto-generating databases of Yield Strength and Grain Size using ChemDataExtractor. Scientific Data, 9(1), 292.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01301-w).

This paper uses ChemDataExtractor to auto-generate databases of yield strength and grain size values by extracting information from the literature. The automatically-extracted data is organized into four databases:

- YieldStrength_Database includes data about yield strength
- GrainSize_Database includes data about grain size
- EngineeringReady_YieldStrength_Database
- Combined_YieldStrength_GrainSize_Database has a subset of columns from YieldStrength_Database and GrainSize_Database

This database is created from a database released for [Na, G. S., & Chang, H. (2022). A public database of thermoelectric materials and system-identified material representation for data-driven discovery. npj Computational Materials, 8(1), 214.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00897-2).

The ESTM dataset (in "estm.xlsx") covers 880 unique thermoelectric materials and provides five experimentally measured thermoelectric properties: Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, power factor, and figure of merit (ZT). There are a total of 5205 rows in the dataset.

Changes include:
- Standardized the DOI Format
- Introduced constraints on specific columns like temperature and thermal conductivity

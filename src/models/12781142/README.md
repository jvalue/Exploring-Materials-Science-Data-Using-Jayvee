This database is created from a database of battery materials data, released for [Zhao, J., & Cole, J. M. (2022). A database of refractive indices and dielectric constants auto-generated using ChemDataExtractor. Scientific data, 9(1), 192.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01295-5). In this paper, an optical property database of refractive indices and dielectric constants is presented, which comprises a total of 49076 refractive indices and 60804 dielectric constant records on 11054 unique chemicals. The database was auto-generated using ChemDataExtractor, based on a corpus of 388461 scientific papers.

Changes include:
- Standardized the DOI Format
- Removed bracers around values that are numbers
- Changed value types to be more fitting
